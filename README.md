This project was about creating a simple recipe collection in HTML.

I used the basics I had learned and expanded on them with attributes and elements I researched along the way to develop a routine for structuring, integrating, and presenting content.

About the recipes: Two of the recipes come from food bloggers whom I have been following for some time and who inspire me. You can find the links to their blogs directly in the recipes.

Have fun cooking!
